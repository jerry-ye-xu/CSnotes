### Hi!

Welcome to my collection of CS notes that I wrote during my studies.

This collection of notes includes:

- ISYS2120: Data & Information Management (SQL notes only)
- DATA3404: Data Science Platforms
- COMP3221: Distributed System

### Reading the notes

You may want to clone the repository into your local computer and import it into Quiver/BoostNotes to read and see the pictures.

If possible, you can render the latex (math) and diagrams in the notes in a markdown rendering program, e.g. [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/).

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me via email at jerryyexu@gmail.com if you have any suggestions or if you spot something.
