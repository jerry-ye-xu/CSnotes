### Function Pointers

Function pointers are, as you might have already guessed, pointers that point to a function.

All you really need to know here is how the syntax works, and why you might need them.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int print_marks(int effort){
    printf("Please input a number from 1 to 10, indicating how much effort you have put into this subject this semester.\n");
    
    int effort;
    scanf("%d", &effort);
    
    if(effort <= 0){
        printf("You're pretty screwed.\n");
        return 0;
    }
    else if(effort <= 5){
        printf("Try harder.\n");
    } else if (effort <= 10){
        printf("Keep trying.\n");
    } else {
        printf("Too much effort.\n");
    }
    return effort;
}

int main(){
    
    int (*function_ptr)(int);
    function_ptr = print_marks;
    
    function_ptr(5); // `effort` is parameter.
    
}
```

The syntax for function pointers is quite straight forward. You create a pointer to a function, specifying a return type and the parameters as you would normally for a function.

The simply assign the address of the function to the function pointer.

### Harder example of Function Pointer

Letâ€™s look at an example where function pointers are put to good use.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* simple exponential, assumes n > 0 */
int n_power(int n, int power){
    for(int i = 1; i < power; i++){
        n *= n;
    }
    printf("n is %d\n", n);
    return n;
}

/* Increment for loops by n steps */
int n_increment(int i, int increment){
    return (i + increment);
}

/* cumulative sum of a sequence of numbers from start to finish, to the power of `power` and incrementing `increment` at a time */
int cum_sum(int (*n_power_ptr)(), int (*up)(), int start, int finish, int power, int increment){
    int total = 0;
    for(int i = start; i < finish; i = (*up)(i, increment)){
		printf("i is %d\n", i);
        total += (*n_power_ptr)(i, power);
    }
	return total;
}

int main(){
    int power, increment, start, finish;
    int (*n_power_ptr)(int, int) = n_power;
    int (*n_increment_ptr)(int, int) = n_increment;
    
    printf("Please input power, increment, start, finish in the format:\n<power> <increment> <start> <finish>\n");
    scanf("%d %d %d %d", &power, &increment, &start, &finish);
    
    int total = cum_sum(n_power_ptr, n_increment_ptr, start, finish, power, increment);
	printf("the total is %d\n", total);
}

```

^ you can check out the details here. 

Basically the idea is that you can have function pointers as parameters to be used inside a function. By passing the relevant parameters, you can execute a single function with more flexibility than using multiple if statements or whatnot in a single function.

Also, you are able to write more modular code and the overall codebase will be more clean and readable.

They are also used for callback functions, which is basically when a different pathways of functions are possible given an output of one function.

`Callback` == defined as when a function is not explicitly called by the programmer.
