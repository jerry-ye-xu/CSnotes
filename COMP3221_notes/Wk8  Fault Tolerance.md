__Key questions__

- What is the difference between failure, fault and error.
- Explain the 3 different types of faults.
- In a distributed system we want our system to be dependable. Outline the 4 characteristics of dependability.
- Define failure models and name and describe 4 failures.
- What is the most serious type of failure, and what is it called?
- Give 2 examples of the type of failure you defined above.
---
- Describe a crash-tolerant synchrnous solution. Include in your description
a) The main idea
b) The algorithm
c) A brief proof for the algorithm
d) A brief example
- Describe a Byzantine-tolerant synchronous solution. Illustrate the ideas with a small example.
- Describe a fault-tolerant asynchronous solution. Do they exist?
---
- Describe two high-level ways we can improve fault-tolerance in distrbuted systems.
- Define "k-fault tolerant".
- Define the consensus problem.
- What are the 3 requirements for solving a consensus problem?
- What are some of the challenges associated with distributed consensus?
- Map out a table of possibilities for distributed consensus, with a/sync vs. un/ordered vs. uni/multicast vs. un/bounded messages. Label the boxes "N/A" for any combination where it is impossible to reach consensus.
