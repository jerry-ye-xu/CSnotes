__Key questions__

- Why is the idea of consistency important w.r.t data storage and replication?
- When does a "conflict" occur?
- Define a consistency model and specify the two main types of consistency models.
- Define (memory) coherence. What is the difference between coherence and consistency?
- What are some examples of types of consistency models for both data-centric and client-centric approaches?
- Define "program order".
- Define execution and serial execution.
- Define equivalent execution.
---
- Briefly describe the idea of sequential consistency. Draw a diagram with a example that violates sequential consistency.
- Draw a diagram that is coherent but not consistent.
- Define causal consistency and explain how it is different from sequential consistency.
- Define FIFO consistency and explain how it is different from causal consistency.
- Describe eventual consistency. What is the assumption that eventual consistency makes?
---
- What is the idea of replication, and why does totally-ordered broadcast not scale well?
- Describe the "primary backup" and "local write primary backup". What is the advantage of the "local write" version?
- Describe quorum-based read-write replication. In particular, describe the constraints that must be followed and explain their purpose.
---
- What are multi-access operations and why do the previously mentioned consistency models fail?
- What does ACID stand for and why is it important?
- Define serialisability.
- Define sequential execution.
- Give an example of serialisable and non-serialisable executions.
- What is "real time precedence"?
- Define linearisability. How it is different to serialisability?
- Give an example of both a linearisable and non-linearisable sequence of executions.
