### __Concepts Overview__

**Define a distributed system.**

A distributed system is a network of nodes that operate by communicating with each other and end users. The distributed system should be transparent, that is, it should appear to end users as a single system.

**What is transparency and what types of transparency are there?**

Transparency is the notion of hiding all operations required to keep the system functioning like a single node. That is, the end user should feel like it is interacting with a single computer.

The 7 types of transparency are:

1) access
2) location
3) migration
4) replication
5) concurrency
6) failure
7) relocation

**Briefly explain the 5 challenges of distributed systems.**

What we will cover in this course:

1) Network communication
2) Consistency
3) Fault-tolerance
4) Security
5) Scalability

**What is considered a resource in distributed systems? Gives some examples.**

Anything really, e.g. RAM, CPU, disc storage etc.
